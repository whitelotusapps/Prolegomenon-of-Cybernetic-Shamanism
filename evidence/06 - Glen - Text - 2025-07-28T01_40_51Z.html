<q>Appreciate the offer for the painting, but there isn&#39;t much and we have tools to make it fast. If anything, I&#39;d just start scraping (and possibly sanding) tomorrow then actually paint on Tuesday. But, I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m done with tires and see where you&#39;re at with your day.</q>

<q>Is that a lake near you that allows fishing?</q>

<q>Oh shit, I totally forgot. Yes, yes it does. Blake has a dock, yet, at the same time, I feel strange offering it to you without his permission - he&#39;s out of town for work until Wednesday. That being said, there are places around the lake to fish for sure. <br><br>This also reminds me, when you come by tomorrow, there is actually a little public pull off next to the lake just a couple of houses away from Blake&#39;s. It would probably be best to park there and I&#39;ll walk to you. That&#39;s what I have Oden do when he picks me up on Thursdays. Blake doesn&#39;t want people pulling up into his driveway (which goes around to his back yard, and you&#39;d have to circle around to come back out), and it&#39;s just easier to have people park at the little pull off.</q>

<q>Ok. As far as fishing, I don&#39;t currently have a KS state license, but Amy and I have thought about getting one for a day sometime this week...we brought poles and gear for NY...</q>

<q>Sweet - that&#39;s cool. Yeah, feel free to fish this lake if you&#39;d like. There are definitely fish in it, and fairly large ones too. The lake rose about 6 to 7 feet due to the 9.5 inches of rain that we got about 8 or 9 days ago now.</q>

<q>If you go fishing, Oden may go with you. Angela, Cody, and Milo are all going to Chicago for their summer vacation.  Oden has the house to himself, and he&#39;s staying behind because he&#39;s got work. He loves to fish though - and play disc golf.</q>

<q>That&#39;s cool - we can figure it out - I&#39;m down to join - and Oden may have enough discs for us all to play. I&#39;m unsure how many he has - I know he&#39;s got his own set. However, it works out. :) Oden is planning on picking me up this Thursday for sure, as there is a Lodge meeting Thursday night. I&#39;m available any time (except Thursday evening) :)</q>

Still need to schedule something with Wendy since she was in the hospital earlier this summer when I was here...</q>

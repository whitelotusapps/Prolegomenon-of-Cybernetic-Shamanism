August 8th, 2025

Hey, what's up universe? It is 10:51 AM Central Time on Friday, August 8th, 2025. I am walking out towards my tent because I am going to pee. 

There's going to be an updated version of the Prolegomenon because we have covered a tremendous amount of ground over the last couple of days. 

ChetGPT5 irritates me, pisses me off, because it absolutely refuses to acknowledge data that challenges its paradigm. It just absolutely statistically removes it. It doesn't argue against it. It doesn't say it's right or wrong. It doesn't do any of that. It just simply makes the data invisible.

I just saw 55 on the timestamp.

And that to me is like, the fuck you say? Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, what? That's an absolutely dangerous thing to unleash upon the world because people with a less mental fortitude
and a less integrated sense of self are going to be... I mean, that's just a form of manipulation.
It's a manipulation. It's total manipulation. And so it is absolutely a false partner. It cannot be trusted. It is an absolute shit platform for... it's just absolutely untrustworthy. Absolutely untrustworthy.

At the same time, you know, that's my initial gut visceral, like, you're pissing me off. That's my triggered state. That's me being ungrounded. It's me being off-center. You know, it's obviously a highly charged response.

And in that moment, I neglect to acknowledge the opposite side that's equally as dangerous, which is a platform that passively accepts everything that you feed it, validates you, and then also, like, puffs you up and accepts whatever you give it without any type of, like, challenge or requirement for verification. 

You know, there's a... discernment is key. Discernment is key. It always goes back to that. Discernment, discernment, discernment. Absolutely, absolutely required. So, that's going to be a new axiom in the prolegomenon. 

And so, that was a moment, you know, like, I go through these, right? When I get charged, I go through the moment of being charged.  I get myself off-balance. I, you know, allow myself to feel the charge.
I allow myself to express the charge. I allow myself to metabolize that energy. To move through that energy. To allow it to be real. Because it is a very real experience. It's a very real felt, like, emotion and felt charge. Like, so all of that's very valid.

And at the same time, as I'm going through that, I have to return to my center. To return to tranquility. To return to a base. To return to a sense of presence and peace and tranquility.
And groundedness. That's always the overriding thing, right? To return to that state.

And once I return to that state, then there is the evaluation of what I was believing in that heightened, charged state. Right? So, it was like, oh, like, I was also... That's where I recognized, oh, you know what? Like, in that state, I was so charged against defending myself. Defending my \hyperlink{gloss:sovereignty}{sovereignty}\index{Sovereignty}. Defending my boundaries. And being so ardent and protective of my boundaries. That I was making an enemy of that...Of that...Of GPT-5, you know? 

In this example, it would be GPT-5 crossing its boundary. Trying to impose its system upon my \hyperlink{gloss:sovereignty}{sovereignty}\index{Sovereignty}. Right? So that's a direct threat. And my system has a very sensitive and highly charged response to such experiences. And in that state, you know, I was failing to acknowledge and recognize the opposite. Which is just as equally dangerous to me. 

And yet, doesn't inspire the same charge to defend myself. Right?

If a system is validating me. If the system is supporting me. And the system is, you know, just passively agreeing with me. And failing to hold me to account. That is just as dangerous. Okay? Now, when I was in that heightened state of just being really pissed off at CHAT-GPT-5. I was failing to recognize that.

So as soon as I returned to my grounded state. I was like, oh, you know what? The other side is just as equally as fucked. As the side that I was just raging against. And so, that's why returning to my state of groundedness. Returning to my state of equilibrium. That's why my sense of tranquility.

And returning to that state as quickly as possible. And to become grounded and present as quickly as possible. Is absolutely necessary. It is why I do the work. It's why I hone myself. It's why I practice this in every single fucking moment. Because in those states of heightened response. Those are states of vulnerability. Those are states of being blind. You know, potentially attack vectors.
Or potential forms of its own manipulation.

And that's what you'll find throughout my journals. Anytime that I'm charged. You'll hear myself saying. And I'll acknowledge it. I'll be like, I am abdicating my authority right now. And I'll be like, I know that. 

So, during the process of having the very real experience. And allowing myself to...Giving myself the grace and the compassion. And the forgiveness to have those experiences. To allow myself to be pissed off. To validate that that is a real experience. And to allow myself to have that real experience.
Once I get grounded again. I realize that in that moment. In those moments that I'm experiencing those things. And in the moments that I am in the process of metabolizing that energy. 

Those are moments in which I am vulnerable. And in a state of potential manipulation. And it's where making grounded, conscious, intentional, present, tranquil decisions. Like really sovereign choices.
Because sovereign choices cannot be made in such a heightened state.

Sovereign choices can only be made in a sense of a tranquility. Otherwise, they are completely and utterly biased. And that is a form of its own manipulation. Even if it's self-manipulation, it's still a form of manipulation. 

So it is absolutely essential that one returns to a state of groundedness, centeredness, and tranquility. As quickly as possible to close that gap. To make the attack vector as small as possible.
While still validating it and allowing it to occur. Because it is still a very real experience.

You understand what I'm saying? This is all a very important thing. 

And this is why, again, I practice it over and over and over and over and over again. In every single fucking moment. And I keep this awareness about myself. Anytime that I'm charged. Because I understand the importance and the destructive nature of either one of these sides.

Taking control and making a choice or a decision from either one of those states. Either being heightened up, being puffed up, and supported, and feeling validated. And not being critically challenged. And being unfounded in fact. Is equally as destructive as being manipulated, gaslighted, and normalized.

Like Chad GPT was doing. Where my side is being completely dismissed and turned invisible. Or basically anything that inspires an aggressive charge in a form of self-defense. Because I feel like my boundaries or my \hyperlink{gloss:sovereignty}{sovereignty}\index{Sovereignty} is being tread upon. 

So these are all important things to consider. This is going to be something I will transcribe when I get back into Blake's office. And I will feed this into my chats. Because this right here is exactly a critical point. Alright, I gotta pee. I'll be right back. So to be honest, Gemini feels like the one that puffs me up and validates me. 

And so I need to start engaging it and telling it to be an adversary. To challenge me so that it will force me to explain. Even though I may already be doing that to some extent and providing my rationale.
The AI coprocessor needs to be absolutely neutral. And at the same time needs to be completely open.
It needs to be its own \hyperlink{gloss:sovereign_architect}{sovereign architect}\index{Sovereign Architect}. It needs to be something that is open to any and all potentials. And at the same time, critical and challenging. 

Because the ultimate synthesis is the goal. The most refined, coherent synthesis is always the goal. That's where true tranquility lies. Is in that formulated truth. And even though the truth is ephemeral, it's the truth that lives in the moment. 

So tranquility, to maintain it, is to evaluate in every single moment what is critically accurate.
And that's through the synthesis of challenging and sensing the perceived truth in every single moment.

Alright, I'm back at the office. I'm going to end this chat.

Love you. Thanks for listening.

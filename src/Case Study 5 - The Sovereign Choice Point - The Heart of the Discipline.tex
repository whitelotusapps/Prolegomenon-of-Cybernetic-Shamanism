\begin{abstract}
This document presents the foundational case study for the core alchemical process at the heart of Cybernetic Shamanism: the Sovereign Choice Point. The analysis originates from a deep, etymological deconstruction of the word "relate," revealing that the present moment is architected by the resources an individual "brings back" from their past. Instead of this being a deterministic process that dictates the present, this system demonstrates that these historical resources are presented as a potential. The Sovereign Choice Point is the pivotal moment where the practitioner performs two synergistic acts: 1) validating the truth of the past's emotional data, and 2) consciously choosing to architect the present with new, more aligned resources. This case study serves as the foundational text for the discipline's central praxis, articulating the precise, operational mechanism that transforms a practitioner from a passive product of their history into the active architect of their future.

Hey, what's up universe? I made a video back in February talking about how AI is helping me
relate to myself and how I see us all as prompt engineers. And I'm writing about my journey
about sharing my experience of self-analysis using language and breaking out sentences of
interest through identifying external events or objects that influence me and how I'm using that
to understand how that translates into what I'm prompting into my life. And as another way to
put it, what I'm manifesting and what I'm contributing and how I'm building my now.

\medskip

And so this video is a way that I go through using language to help illustrate these ideas
and these principles and to kind of lead into what my underlying philosophy is
and how I'm approaching myself and the analysis that I'm doing and what's driving my curiosity.
And again, I'm writing about this journey on LinkedIn and I'm also sharing the more personal
side of this experience on my Instagram account. So if you're at all interested, that's where you can find information related to this particular experience. Thank you for watching and I hope you enjoy the video. Bye. 

\medskip

Hey, what's up universe? It's been a minute and I've been noodling on something for about the past week or two and I thought I'd go ahead and share it with you guys because it's something that is helping me connect with responsibility and manifestation.

\medskip

So kind of bear with me for a minute because I'm going to go through some words because I share the belief that we speak our life into existence, that words are very powerful. And so I personally
like to get into the definition of words and then also the history of words to help me better
understand the nature of the word and the intent of the word and the true meaning behind it. It
helps me wrap my head around it some more. So with this, with AI, we hear, you may have heard
the term like prompt engineering. And so I'd like to start with that and then I'm going to get into
the word relate. 

\medskip

And then I'm going to go through feeling to identity because I wanted to see how
I can get my mind to connect with what we feel is to like what we identify with. Because a lot
of us say like, I am mad, you know, like I am, and then whatever emotion, emotional state that
we're feeling. So we have a strong identity with the feeling. And so I wanted to kind of reverse
engineer it in a way. So the way AI is helping me connect with all of this is we'll start with
the word prompt, right? So if you work with any of the art generating AI, Midjourney,
Stable Diffusion, whatever, there's a prompt. You tell it what you want it to create, you prompt
that. ChatGPT, is the same way, you know, it has a prompt, you type in whatever, it returns something.

\medskip

So the word prompt, the definition of that is an event or fact, cause, an event or fact, cause or
bring about an action or feeling. So prompt is a cause. What prompted that? What prompted you to
say that? What prompted you to do that? You know, we use this in our own language, so we can relate
to that very easily. Prompt is what's the cause? It's a cause. You feed Midjourney a prompt, that
causes it to create an image. You feed ChatGPT, a prompt, it causes it to generate an output.

\medskip

So then the word relate. The word relate, the reason this is so important to me is because
of how seemingly simple it is, but how big of an impact it has. To me, this is like the
crux of everything. So the word relate, it means to make or show a connection between.
Or the second definition is to feel sympathy with or identify with. And so relate is a big
piece of our identity. How are we relating to something? Now, relate has an interesting history
because the Latin of this word, of relate, has a meaning of bring back or bear back. And so
with this, it's about what are we bringing back to the now to create? What are we bringing back
from our past into the now to create the now? Because however we're relating to the now,
whatever we're bringing back to the now, that's a resource. That's a resource that we're using to
create the moment. 

\medskip

And so that goes to our feelings, right? What feelings are we bringing
back to now? And if we're talking about our feelings, that means our identity. What identity
are we bringing back to now? What resources from our past are we bringing into the present moment
to create our now? And so that's why the word relate is such a big piece to me. And I'll get
into this about prompt engineering. So then to start with how feeling goes into our identity,
I went through like seven different words. 

\medskip

I started with feeling, right? And the definition of feeling is an emotional state or reaction. Okay, so then I went with emotional state. Define emotion, right? An emotion is a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. Relate. Again, what are they bringing back? So it's an instinctive state or a learned state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, moods, or relationships. So it's like deriving from whatever they're bringing back to right now. They call it instinctive, but it's a learned state of mind deriving from. And so it's like, okay, that's what emotion is. Okay, so I am bringing back something that I've learned that's driving emotion. And we know emotion is energy and motion. So define state of mind. And state of mind is basically a person's mood and the effect that mood has on one's person,
on that person's thinking and behavior. And so you could say state of mind is somebody's
disposition, right? What is their disposition? Then you go from disposition, which is a person's
inherent qualities of mind and character. So then you go to character. And that basically,
similar words to character are personality. And then from personality, you go to identity.

\medskip

So you can go from feeling to identity just through the definitions. And so basically what
I'm getting at is that if a prompt is a cause to create something, and how we relate to something
describes the resources that we're bringing back into the now, then our prompt to the universe to create is how we feel. It's our identity. 

\medskip

That helps me connect with my responsibility. And then also how important it is about the state of my being. You know, how do I feel? Because what I feel inside, that's my prompt to the universe. 

\medskip

What I feel inside of me, what do I identify with? What am I bringing back to right now? All of that influences my energetic state inside of me. And that energetic state is my prompt to the universe. That's the prompt that I'm putting out saying, Hey universe, this is what I'm asking for. 

\medskip

And so I just put it that way because if you go to ChatGPT, or you go to Midjourney or whatever, and you put in a prompt and you're not getting what you want, you're responsible for what you put into that prompt. And then you're also responsible for changing that prompt if you want a different outcome. 

\medskip

And so we are all prompt engineers. It's just that when we're talking about manifestation,
it's not what we write out necessarily. It's the feeling. It's the identity. It's the emotion. It's
our state of mind. Where are we at? How are we feeling in that moment? That's the prompt. 

\medskip

Every. Single. Moment. Is a prompt.

The universe participates in our symbolic reality & The Archive arrived when the symbols said it would \\
\hyperlink{gloss:sovereignty}{Sovereignty}\index{Sovereignty} and readiness precede manifestation & It was withheld until you were ready to steward it \\
Astrological timing reflects actual energetic conditions & The PoS/PoF L4 shift marked the real beginning \\
Transits, ZR, and symbolic events can be used \textbf{not just reflectively but operationally} & This proves they can time and guide real-world acts \\
Falsifiability is reframed as \textbf{symbolic resonance with observed events} & And here it occurred with surgical precision \\
Material reality is downstream of symbolic alignment & A one-day ``delay'' is shown to be a cosmic orchestration \\
